                The best way to start creating data on the Ceramic Network is to create it. This is
                going to be a step by step guide to get you started. For this we'll be building some
                sample blog posts, but you can use any data as long as it's structured as a JSON
                object.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Let's make sure you're authenticated. In your browser's inspector window open up
                  the 'console' tab & enter <code>ceramic.did.id</code>. You should see something
                  like <code>did:3:...</code>. If you don't refresh the page & re-authenticate your
                  DID.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let's start by disecting the following command:<br />
                  <code>
                    const post1 = await TileDocument.create(ceramic, {
                    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;title:'My first Tile', <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;body: 'My first
                    Tile', <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;author: ceramic.did.id <br />}) </code
                  ><br />
                  First, TileDocument.create() is the method to create a new tile. It requires two
                  arguments, the ceramic client and the tile data. Now you're ready to run the
                  command and create your tile!
                </li>
                <li>
                  You might have seen in your console that it returned undefined. This is because
                  we're creating, not querying the tile. To see the details about it run
                  <code>post1.content</code> and your browser will show you the content you just
                  created!
                </li>
                <li>
                  That's cool, but what happens when you close your browser and your inspector
                  forgets what we created? That's where the StreamID comes into play. Run
                  <code>post1.id.toString()</code> to see your StreamID. If you're familiar with
                  databases this is similar to your primary key. We can then load a stream by
                  running the following:
                  <code>TileDocument.load(ceramic, post1.id.toString())</code>. You can copy & paste
                  the string from the first command in this step but you don't need to.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                That's it! You've now created & loaded your data on Ceramic. You might be wondering
                how you can load your data without writing down the StreamID or storing it
                somewhere, that's really where the Identity Index protocol comes in handy.

            <div class="body">
              <p>
                Now that you've created a tile it's time to work on creating data associated with
                your personal DID. We've provided the DID-DataStore that has the BasicProfile schema
                already loaded so all we have to do is use it.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If you haven't worked with Ceramic or the Web Playground in the past take a look
                  at "Firing Your First Tile".
                </li>
                <li>
                  Before we jump into using our DID-DataStore, let's take a look at how it's
                  configured. You can find the source code
                  <a
                    href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/web-playground/blob/main/src/datastore.ts#L10"
                    >on GitHub</a
                  >. If you take a look you can see that we're providing a 'publishedModel' to our
                  DID-DataStore, this is a manual way to provide the Schema & Definition to
                  DID-DataStore, you can also use a DataModel that has been published to NPM for
                  this to make it easier.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now that we've set up the groundwork, we can actually interact with DID-DataStore.
                  So let's start by querying your profile, all you need to do is run:
                  <code>await DataStore.get('basicProfile')</code>
                  <br />
                  You might see a JSON response if you've used
                  <a href="https://clay.self.id">Self.ID</a> to create a profile in the past, or you
                  might just see <code>undefined</code>. Unless you see an error message you're good
                  to move to the next step.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Retrieving your profile is fine, but what about another persons profile? You can
                  easily query this by providing their DID! Let's take a look at my profile. My DID
                  is:
                  <code>did:3:bafyreihq3gquqeuzblcpckqoanlftg7zp3wivkvg26mzfiwvau45rrepie</code> and
                  with that we can run
                  <code
                    >await DataStore.get('basicProfile',
                    'did:3:bafyreihq3gquqeuzblcpckqoanlftg7zp3wivkvg26mzfiwvau45rrepie')</code
                  >
                  and retrieve my profile, if you were building your own app
                  <code>ceramic.did.id</code> would reference the DID that is authenticating the
                  Ceramic instance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  So, we've done a lot of querying and no creation. We can <em>almost</em> fix that.
                  First let's talk a bit about best practices. DataStore provides two different
                  utilities for updating a record. The first should ONLY be used when you're
                  creating a Tile for the first time, this being <code>DataStore.set()</code>. If
                  you call this on a record that already has content you will be overwriting all
                  other data in the tile (the stream will maintain it's history though so not all is
                  lost). The second option is the recommended way to create & update data on
                  Ceramic. This is <code>DataStore.merge()</code>, the main difference is that using
                  merge will only update the fields that we are providing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, we can write to our profile. As mentioned above, we want to be sure to
                  use the right write method and provide good data to use.
                  <code
                    >await DataStore.merge('basicProfile', {name: 'YOUR NAME HERE', description:
                    'Tell us about yourself!', emoji: '✌🏻' }</code
                  >
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                That's it! You've now created (or updated) your basicProfile using DID-DataStore, if
                you take a look at <a href="#" id="profile-cta">Self.ID</a> you can see your profile
                has already been updated. Welcome to the world of interoperable data, we're happy to
                have you here.
